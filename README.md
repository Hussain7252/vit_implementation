# Vision Transformers Unveiled: Implementing and Training for Image Classification

## Project Overview
This project details the implementation of Vit and SimpleVit and explores the use of **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for image classification tasks. Apply the Transformer architectureâ€”originally developed for NLP tasks, achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets here with respect to ResNet50V2.

## Key Features
- Implements Vit and SimpleVit in PyTorch
- Utilizes the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model to perform image classification.
- Preprocesses image data for compatibility with ViT, including **patching** and **embedding** layers.
- Trains the ViT model on a classification dataset and evaluates its performance using standard metrics.
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer-based models for computer vision tasks compared to CNNs.

## Objective
The objective of this project is learn in details about Vision Transformers and demonstrate it's image classification capability, offering an alternative to traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks.
